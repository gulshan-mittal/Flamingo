### Idea Proposal


The ultimate aim of the our idea is to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, and manage the impact of natural disasters. For this, we will build a web app (due to shortage of time but is scoped to deploy on mobile for end users) which will provides many facilities to predict, prevent and manage the impacts of natural disaster. The App  will provide remote monitoring of natural disasters and relief responses along with automated suggestions of relief centres to provide relief from disaster.


#### Predict

The App will predict if the individual is safe or not according to his/her location and for this we are using ML algorithms on data provided by various third party organisations and will provide initial warnings for when severe weather occurs.


#### Prevent

If there is any chance of occurence of any natural disaster predicted by our app, weather or forecast department then we will alert the individual by sending SMS or danger warning. If the natural disaster occurs then we will provide SMS alerts to victims in the area with directions to the nearest relief centre along with heatmap generation with the location of victims in the region to direct response. Monitoring of hospitals in the area and their status updation will also be focussed.


#### Management

To manage the conditions during natural disaster the app sends the location of victim to the disaster management/ relief/ helping  organisations.It reduces the delay in services and try to ensure that  resources should reach the victims as early as possible.The families can also get information about their relatives by merely uploading their photos. We will also take the help of social networking sites like facebook or twitter to spread information about the disaster stricken areas.
